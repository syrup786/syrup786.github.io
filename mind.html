	<p>Brainwave frequencies are the rhythmic electrical patterns generated by the synchronized activity of billions of neurons in the brain. These electrical impulses can be detected and measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive technique that records brain activity through electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>
	<p>The brain produces these electrical signals constantly, even during sleep or when a person is seemingly inactive. The different brainwave frequencies are classified based on their frequency range, which is measured in Hertz (Hz). Each frequency band is associated with specific mental states, cognitive processes, and emotional experiences. Here are the main brainwave frequencies and their characteristics: Here are brief notes on the main brainwave frequencies:</p>
	<p><strong>Delta Waves (0.5-3 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Predominant during deep sleep or unconsciousness.</li>
		<li>Associated with the restorative and healing functions of sleep.</li>
		<li>Delta waves are essential for physical and mental rejuvenation.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Theta Waves (4-7 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur during deep relaxation, light sleep, or creative states.</li>
		<li>Associated with daydreaming, visualization, and accessing the subconscious mind.</li>
		<li>Theta waves are prevalent during deep meditation and some stages of sleep.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Alpha Waves (8-12 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur when the brain is in a relaxed and calm state but still awake.</li>
		<li>Associated with a meditative or reflective state.</li>
		<li>Alpha waves are present during light meditation and daydreaming.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Beta Waves (13-30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Associated with wakeful and alert states.</li>
		<li>Predominant during active thinking, problem-solving, and concentration.</li>
		<li>High levels of beta waves can indicate stress or anxiety.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Gamma Waves (above 30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Highest frequency brainwaves.</li>
		<li>Associated with high-level cognitive functions, perception, and problem-solving.</li>
		<li>Gamma waves are believed to be linked to peak performance and heightened awareness.</li>
	</ul></p>	
	<p>Each brainwave frequency serves a unique purpose and plays a crucial role in various aspects of human cognition, emotion, and overall well-being. Researchers continue to study brainwave frequencies to better understand the brain's complexities and their potential applications in areas such as meditation, sleep improvement, and cognitive enhancement.</p>

	<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Know what you want. Manifestation is fairly similar to asking wishes from a genie: if you don’t know what you want, things are about to get pretty confusing and messy. Be specific in your wishes. For example, don’t wish for “good grades”. Instead, wish for “A’s in all 7 of my classes in both semesters in 2020-2021”! </p>
	<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Ask the universe. To manifest, one must believe they already have it. To amplify your signal and your desires to the universe, you can meditate, visualize, or utilize the popular 3-6-9 method. Let’s go over the 3-6-9 method (brought to attention by Clark Kegley):</p>
	<p>1. Pick 3 affirmations that you want.</p>
	<p>2. Say them 6 times a day.</p>
	<p>3. Focus on your wants for 9 seconds as a way to just think about what you want to manifest.</p>
	<p>While Kegley mentions that desires will manifest after 21 days of doing this method, it’s important to note that manifestations are an echo from the universe; there is no deadline. Remember to be patient and understand that these things will take time.</p>
	<p>To meditate, you must strive to clear your mind and meditate to see all perspectives. For manifestation to work via this process, you must be subconsciously aware of your surroundings and trust your intuition; don’t give up hope, as it weakens your intuition!</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Actively work towards your manifestations. An important part of manifestations is your coexistence with the universe. While you call to the universe and expect a call back, you must work towards these manifestations actively. The universe builds upon your efforts to provide you your desires. Based on our previous example, manifesting good grades won’t work unless you actively work towards them. Expecting the universe to provide with no base will cause the manifestation to weaken or fail.</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> Vibe check! The strength of your manifestations is solely based on your resonance with the universe; for you to reap the best possible benefits, strive to maintain a positive frequency for the universe to reflect back upon. In other words, try to have good vibes!</p>
	<p>Now that you have a deeper understanding in manifestation, have fun! Call to the universe, and be sure to listen for its response.</p>
