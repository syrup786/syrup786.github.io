	<p>Brainwave frequencies are the rhythmic electrical patterns generated by the synchronized activity of billions of neurons in the brain. These electrical impulses can be detected and measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive technique that records brain activity through electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>
	<p>The brain produces these electrical signals constantly, even during sleep or when a person is seemingly inactive. The different brainwave frequencies are classified based on their frequency range, which is measured in Hertz (Hz). Each frequency band is associated with specific mental states, cognitive processes, and emotional experiences. Here are the main brainwave frequencies and their characteristics: Here are brief notes on the main brainwave frequencies:</p>
	<p><strong>Delta Waves (0.5-3 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Predominant during deep sleep or unconsciousness.</li>
		<li>Associated with the restorative and healing functions of sleep.</li>
		<li>Delta waves are essential for physical and mental rejuvenation.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Theta Waves (4-7 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur during deep relaxation, light sleep, or creative states.</li>
		<li>Associated with daydreaming, visualization, and accessing the subconscious mind.</li>
		<li>Theta waves are prevalent during deep meditation and some stages of sleep.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Alpha Waves (8-12 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur when the brain is in a relaxed and calm state but still awake.</li>
		<li>Associated with a meditative or reflective state.</li>
		<li>Alpha waves are present during light meditation and daydreaming.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Beta Waves (13-30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Associated with wakeful and alert states.</li>
		<li>Predominant during active thinking, problem-solving, and concentration.</li>
		<li>High levels of beta waves can indicate stress or anxiety.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Gamma Waves (above 30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Highest frequency brainwaves.</li>
		<li>Associated with high-level cognitive functions, perception, and problem-solving.</li>
		<li>Gamma waves are believed to be linked to peak performance and heightened awareness.</li>
	</ul></p>	
	<p>Each brainwave frequency serves a unique purpose and plays a crucial role in various aspects of human cognition, emotion, and overall well-being. Researchers continue to study brainwave frequencies to better understand the brain's complexities and their potential applications in areas such as meditation, sleep improvement, and cognitive enhancement.</p>

      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
	<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Know what you want. Manifestation is fairly similar to asking wishes from a genie: if you don’t know what you want, things are about to get pretty confusing and messy. Be specific in your wishes. For example, don’t wish for “good grades”. Instead, wish for “A’s in all 7 of my classes in both semesters in 2020-2021”! </p>
	<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Ask the universe. To manifest, one must believe they already have it. To amplify your signal and your desires to the universe, you can meditate, visualize, or utilize the popular 3-6-9 method. Let’s go over the 3-6-9 method (brought to attention by Clark Kegley):</p>
	<p><strong>1.</strong> Pick 3 affirmations that you want.</p>
	<p><strong>2.</strong> Say them 6 times a day.</p>
	<p><strong>3.</strong> Focus on your wants for 9 seconds as a way to just think about what you want to manifest.</p>
	<p>While Kegley mentions that desires will manifest after 21 days of doing this method, it’s important to note that manifestations are an echo from the universe; there is no deadline. Remember to be patient and understand that these things will take time.</p>
	<p>To meditate, you must strive to clear your mind and meditate to see all perspectives. For manifestation to work via this process, you must be subconsciously aware of your surroundings and trust your intuition; don’t give up hope, as it weakens your intuition!</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Actively work towards your manifestations. An important part of manifestations is your coexistence with the universe. While you call to the universe and expect a call back, you must work towards these manifestations actively. The universe builds upon your efforts to provide you your desires. Based on our previous example, manifesting good grades won’t work unless you actively work towards them. Expecting the universe to provide with no base will cause the manifestation to weaken or fail.</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> Vibe check! The strength of your manifestations is solely based on your resonance with the universe; for you to reap the best possible benefits, strive to maintain a positive frequency for the universe to reflect back upon. In other words, try to have good vibes!</p>
	<p>Now that you have a deeper understanding in manifestation, have fun! Call to the universe, and be sure to listen for its response.</p>

      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
	<p>Psychic influence is one of the most interesting topics in the psychic field and one of the easy to develop powers without much experience. Anyone can use this power with little effort once they start practicing it. Every one of us use this power in our daily lives either consciously or unconsciously to influence someone to obey you and do your work or to make someone to act in a particular way. Even others too influence us without our knowledge or intention.</p>
	<p>Most of us influence others by meeting them and communicating with them directly. But, psychic influence is a method of influencing by just using your mind from a distance. The influenced person would never come to know that you have used your psychic power to influence them and act naturally as if he or she doing that work according to their will.</p>
	<p>Psychic influence can be used for either good or bad, but it is strictly recommended to use only for the highest good of all. This power can be used for anything, from negotiating to seduction. If you use this power to influence someone to do something bad or to cause bad, then the bad will come to you in 10 fold. The general occasions where you can use this power are negotiating with the sales person, influencing your boss to approve your proposal, making someone to help you in your matters, approval for your bank loan, and so on.</p>
	<p>Every day, when we think of someone, we actually are projecting our psychic power to them. The person on the other side will also act in some or other way according to our thinking if our thoughts are powerful. The more bonding relationship between two of you, the more he or she will be influenced, no matter how much the distance is. But, once you develop your powers, the person will get influenced even if you both do not have any relationship.</p>
	<p>You must remember that, using your powers only one time is generally not enough to influence anyone. Projecting your thoughts must be done repeatedly and with an intense focus. Also remember that if the person is protected by a psychic shield or have some psychic self defense, then it is almost impossible for you to influence him.</p>
	<p><strong>Principles of Psychic Influence:</strong></p>
	<p>According to a book “Clairvoyance and Occult Powers By Swami Panchadasi”, in order to develop your psychic power to influence others, you must impress the three principles stated below in your mind. The three principles are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Strong Desire:</strong> The first step to success in anything is to cultivate a strong intense desire. When you have a will power and a burning desire in your mind, the thoughts you send will have a power to manifest your wish or intention.</li>
		<li><strong>Clear Visualization:</strong> The next step of course is the most crucial one and may need some practice to achieve this. Visualization is the key step to impress our thoughts and influence the person. Whether it is an idea or a feeling or may be something you want the other person to do, it is important to imagine and picture the person in your mind clearly.</li>
		<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Concentration is another step required for your success in influencing the person. You need focus upon the suggestion or an impression you want to plant on the other persons mind. When you concentrate, your energies will be conserved and used in a proper way. Concentration awakens our mind powers and channels them in a particular direction.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The greater the degree you can learn these three mental conditions, the greater will be your success in performing a psychic influence. A daily meditation will help you to achieve these conditions.</p>
	<p><strong>Psychic Influence Techniques:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Relax:</strong> Get in a comfortable position and relax either by doing meditation or by listening to an audio. You can buy one if you wish from here either a brainwaves or hypnosis audio. This will help you to focus your thoughts and project it.</li>
		<li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Now the next step is to visualize in your mind what you want the other person to do. Picture in your mind, the other person doing or feeling according to your suggestions.</li>
		<li><strong>Project:</strong> While visualizing as in above step, project the energy on to the other person forehead. Imagine energy like a fine thread passing in to their forehead.</li>
		<li><strong>Use Phrase:</strong> Use some phrase which describes your intention and say it in your mind while projecting your energy in to their forehead. Use energy and concentration as much as possible when you send your message. You can say a message something like, “John accepts (your name) proposal”.</li>
		<li><strong>Hold the Thought:</strong> Hold the thought for a while, may be a minute or two and then just relax.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Always remember that you must be in a relaxed state while doing psychic influence and must not force yourself which will make you more stress. The technique must be used repeatedly on consistent basis to have a profound image on the other persons mind.</p>
	<p>Our minds have a massive power and you can learn more secrets of mind power here.</p>

      <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
	<p>I’ve spoken a lot of manifestation and the law of attraction here on the blog, about how it changed my life, how to use scripting to manifest your ideal day, 10 ways to raise your vibrations – hell, we’ve even discussed a casual shamanic tapping now and again – but I realised last night, I’ve never actually gone back to basics, focusing on manifestation for beginners, and how to approach the Law of Attraction as a spiritual newbie.<p>
	<p>It’s very easy when you’ve been studying something for a while (I started my self-discovery journey into all things spiritual back in 2016 when I persevered with The Secret Audible book for the third time) to forget that other people don’t really have a clue what you’re talking about.</p>
	<p>To me, speaking about how I attract amazing things into my life seems simple, but that’s only because I know the basics.  Ask me the difference between a Hollandaise sauce and Bearnaise sauce (Friends reference anyone?) and I wouldn’t have a clue.</p>
	<p>So today I’m sharing my manifestation for beginners guide in a bid to help more people to raise their vibrations, switch up your mindset, attract the things you truly want into your life and realise the opportunities are endless.</p>
	<p>Starting with…</p>
	<p>BEING SPECIFIC</p>
	<p>The line “Ask, Believe, Receive” is synonymous with the Law of Attraction, but over the years I’ve worked on other mindset shifts that can really increase your energetic pull – by this I mean, how quickly you’re able to attract things into your life.</p>
	<p>The first of those is by being specific.</p>
	<p>When you want to attract something into your life, you need to put your order into the universe like you would shopping on ASOS.  You want the black dress, size 14 in the Tall range.  You’re very specific about what you would like to order, the same goes for speaking to the universe.</p>
	<p>Let’s say we’re starting at our manifestation for beginners journey and you want to start small to build your trust and belief in the universe.  My first conscious manifestation (I’ve been doing it all my life without realising) was to manifest a pink feather.  Soon after reading The Secret and deciding to give it a go, I received a press package with a pink feather stuck alongside the gift.  Coincidence or universe?  I don’t care.</p>
	<p>Perhaps you want to see a yellow car, or a penguin even. It sounds silly but choosing something you wouldn’t normally see makes it all the more amazing when you do spot it.  I’m manifesting seeing Idris Elba naked as we speak, come through for me girl.</p>
	<p>If you want to manifest money, be specific in the amount of pounds and pence you’d like.  For example, I wanted to make £6,000 in the month of July.  I asked the universe for £6,000, I carried through the steps below, kept my vibrations high, took the action, and low and behold by the 31st July, I had agreed to over £6,000 worth of work.</p>
	<p>I knew exactly why I wanted that amount, I had plans for the money and I was very specific in what I was asking for.  I didn’t say, oh I’d love to be able to pay my credit card and maybe a little bit more for spending money for my LA trip.  I knew exact figures, what I was going to do with that money, and I kindly put in my order.</p>
	<p>ASK THE UNIVERSE</p>
	<p>But what do I mean by asking the universe?  Where do you start? </p>
	<p>First of all, you ask with respect.  This sounds completely woo, but to me the universe is a being, it’s energy, it’s a she in my eyes and that’s why I ask her, I thank her and I trust in her.  You don’t order your food in a restaurant in a rude manner, so please and thank yous are still relevant in my spiritual house.</p>
	<p>There are many different ways you can actually speak to the universe, but I like to write mine down and speak out loud.  For me, it’s a form of praying to a higher force, so I’ll either speak out loud to her and ask for what I would like, or I’ll write a journal entry about what I would like to have, why, and how thankful I am that it’s on its way.  For example, a journal entry could read like this:</p>
	<p><i>“THANK YOU SO MUCH UNIVERSE FOR HELPING ME TO ATTRACT A NEW CLIENT INTO MY BUSINESS WHO NOT ONLY PAYS EXACTLY WHAT I ASK FOR, AND ON TIME EACH AND EVERY MONTH, BUT GIVES ME THE CREATIVE FREEDOM I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. I’M SO THANKFUL YOU HAVE HELPED ME WELCOME THIS CLIENT INTO MY LIFE AND I AM EXCITED TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR BUSINESS EVEN FURTHER.”</i></p>
	<p>Do you see how I journal as if it’s already happened?  I spoke about this in my scripting blog post, but by writing it in the present tense as if it’s already happened, you’re signalling to the universe that you already believe it to be yours.  Which is an amazing thing.</p>
	<p>How often should you write?  Some people say ask one and let it go.  I believe that reinforcing those positive feelings every now and again doesn’t hurt, so write as little or as often as you’d like.  Sometimes doubt can creep in, we’re human after all, so when that happens, just reinstate those feelings and journal about how excited you are to have whatever you’re manifesting in your life.</p>
	<p>Another way of asking the universe is to create a vision board, where you cut out words and images which evoke the feeling of how you’ll feel when you receive your order.  Is it a new car you want to picture, or a holiday for example?  Cut out images of your specific car, or beautiful tranquil beaches, people laughing or the sunset. Vision boards are a really fun way to spend an afternoon, especially if you invite fellow-minded woo friends over and have a vision board and pizza party!</p>
	<p>When I’m putting a vision board together (I need to do a new one soon, so a detailed blog post will be coming about how I do this properly in the next couple of weeks), I like to stick to an absolute maximum of three things I’m manifesting.  You can do more, but to be completely honest, I prefer to focus on one thing at a time so I’m not overloading the universe with orders. You work in a way which feels comfortable and easy to you.</p>
	<p>BELIEVE IN THE UNIVERSE</p>
	<p>Now we get to the difficult part for many.  Believing.  How do you believe in something you’ve never experienced before?  I don’t want to get too spiritual, but it’s about changing your mindset to the what if.  The “oh my god, what if this actually works?” and the “what if I do attract the opportunity to buy a new car into my life” – it turns the usual negative connotation linked to “what if” on its head and let’s you get excited about all the new possibilities.</p>
	<p>Because I have my own living proof that manifestation works, I find it much easier to lay in bed when I’m visualising and let myself get excited and really feel how I am going to feel when my dreams come true. Excited, happy, amazed, calm.  The list goes on.</p>
	<p>A manifestation I want to work on soon (I told you I take this one order at a time), is to buy a BMW X4. I didn’t used to be a car person, but I went to view one recently and I instantly fell in love.  I’m not ashamed to say I manifest material things as much as I manifest emotional things.  And you shouldn’t be either.  Having more money in my life has enabled me to help so many more people than I could when I was on a basic living wage. But I digress – money mindset and the way people view manifesting material items is for a whole other blog post, but let it be known, manifesting what makes you happy and raises your energetic vibes is never a negative thing.</p>
	<p>In short, let yourself really feel the feels.  Get excited.  Do a happy dance (is that just me?). Start living as if your manifestation has already come true.  For example, when I’m driving my car now I already imagine that I’m in my new car, that the outside of the car I’m driving already looks like a BMW.  It’s why I went to view one and inquire about cost, because I believe it will be mine, so I’m already starting the process.</p>
	<p>RECEIVE & TAKE INSPIRED ACTION</p>
	<p>Contrary to what many cynics say (“Well I want to win the lottery so where’s my money?”), the universe doesn’t just deliver your order in a straight and simple way.  If I’m manifesting money, I don’t expect a man to turn up on my doorstep with a briefcase full of twenties.</p>
	<p>Quite the opposite, I’ve learnt to open my eyes to opportunities that she’s put in front of my eyes and to take something called inspired action. Inspired action is when you meet the universe halfway and take steps towards making your dreams come true – not just sit on your bum and wait for miracles to appear.</p>
	<p>For example, last month when I wanted to manifest a certain amount of money through my business, I started to see so many more opportunities than I usually would if I’d have had my head down working in a less than positive and open mindset.</p>
	<p>I received a press invite which I would usually delete if I was unable to go, but this time, I emailed each company back, explained LNER trains had my metaphorical balls in a clasp and I was unable to get down to London from Leeds at short notice.  I passed on my media kit and pitched to them why I believed we’d be a great match working together and hey presto, I had three campaigns set for September.</p>
	<p>You might spot something in a Facebook group that you can help with, you might hear of a friend that needs guidance in your chosen field, you might receive an email for something half price.  I manifested a Dyson vacuum cleaner this way, after putting it at the very top of my wish list I make at the start of every year – two days later I got an email from eBay saying they had a half-price sale on the Dyson I wanted to buy.  Clever marketeers reading my journal, or the universe, I don’t care.  My rug is now spotless.</p>
	<p>If you’re starting small, you might have asked the universe to show a penguin. That doesn’t mean you’re waiting for a penguin to walk in front of your car.  It could be on a jumper.  It could be a children’s toy you spot, or on the TV.  But it will show up, the key is not to be focused on the how.</p>
	<p>Open yourself up to the possibilities.</p>
	<p>BE GRATEFUL</p>
	<p>This is the final point in this manifestation for beginners post, and one that I think many people forget to do. You get so excited that you’ve managed to attract something this amazing into your life, that you want to start all over again and manifest something else.  Without really giving thanks to the universe.</p>
	<p>How do I show how grateful I am?  By writing a gratitude list every single night.  Now, this isn’t just for the enteral positives, because we’re human and I’m realistic.  We’re all going to have really shit things that happen in life.  And I mean, really shit.  When you want to write a “is this seriously my life” kind of list.  But stick with me here.</p>
	<p>By spending five minutes every night thinking about 10 things that have happened that day that you’re grateful for, it can change your mindset so much.  I find writing about that specific day helps massively because if not, you’ll find yourself writing the same things over and over again.</p>
	<p>Yesterday’s list for me included a thank you text someone sent, a coaching call that I had which made me feel instantly lighter, having chance to watch a new show on TV, having nice food in the fridge to be able to cook something for tea (fish finger sandwich in case you were wondering) and the list went on.</p>
	<p>Take some time and realise how fortunate you are in comparison to others.  If you’re alive, you’re doing better than the person in the stars.</p>
	<p>I really hope this back to basics post on manifestation for beginners, albeit 2169 words long, has helped to explain how manifestation works in a simple format.</p>
	<p>Be specific in what you’d like, choose how to ask the universe, believe that it will happen and enjoy the feelings of getting excited, take inspired action and be open to how you will receive your opportunities and finally, and most importantly, be grateful for the great things to come into your life.</p>
	<p>Let me know if you give your first manifestation a try and when it works – not if it works. And if you like this manifestation for beginners guide, why not share it with someone on social media to welcome another spiritual newbie into the club.</p>
