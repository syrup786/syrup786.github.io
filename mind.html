	<p>Brainwave frequencies are the rhythmic electrical patterns generated by the synchronized activity of billions of neurons in the brain. These electrical impulses can be detected and measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive technique that records brain activity through electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>
	<p>The brain produces these electrical signals constantly, even during sleep or when a person is seemingly inactive. The different brainwave frequencies are classified based on their frequency range, which is measured in Hertz (Hz). Each frequency band is associated with specific mental states, cognitive processes, and emotional experiences. Here are the main brainwave frequencies and their characteristics: Here are brief notes on the main brainwave frequencies:</p>
	<p><strong>Delta Waves (0.5-3 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Predominant during deep sleep or unconsciousness.</li>
		<li>Associated with the restorative and healing functions of sleep.</li>
		<li>Delta waves are essential for physical and mental rejuvenation.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Theta Waves (4-7 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur during deep relaxation, light sleep, or creative states.</li>
		<li>Associated with daydreaming, visualization, and accessing the subconscious mind.</li>
		<li>Theta waves are prevalent during deep meditation and some stages of sleep.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Alpha Waves (8-12 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Occur when the brain is in a relaxed and calm state but still awake.</li>
		<li>Associated with a meditative or reflective state.</li>
		<li>Alpha waves are present during light meditation and daydreaming.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Beta Waves (13-30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Associated with wakeful and alert states.</li>
		<li>Predominant during active thinking, problem-solving, and concentration.</li>
		<li>High levels of beta waves can indicate stress or anxiety.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><strong>Gamma Waves (above 30 Hz):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Highest frequency brainwaves.</li>
		<li>Associated with high-level cognitive functions, perception, and problem-solving.</li>
		<li>Gamma waves are believed to be linked to peak performance and heightened awareness.</li>
	</ul></p>	
	<p>Each brainwave frequency serves a unique purpose and plays a crucial role in various aspects of human cognition, emotion, and overall well-being. Researchers continue to study brainwave frequencies to better understand the brain's complexities and their potential applications in areas such as meditation, sleep improvement, and cognitive enhancement.</p>

      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
	<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Know what you want. Manifestation is fairly similar to asking wishes from a genie: if you don’t know what you want, things are about to get pretty confusing and messy. Be specific in your wishes. For example, don’t wish for “good grades”. Instead, wish for “A’s in all 7 of my classes in both semesters in 2020-2021”! </p>
	<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Ask the universe. To manifest, one must believe they already have it. To amplify your signal and your desires to the universe, you can meditate, visualize, or utilize the popular 3-6-9 method. Let’s go over the 3-6-9 method (brought to attention by Clark Kegley):</p>
	<p><strong>1.</strong> Pick 3 affirmations that you want.</p>
	<p><strong>2.</strong> Say them 6 times a day.</p>
	<p><strong>3.</strong> Focus on your wants for 9 seconds as a way to just think about what you want to manifest.</p>
	<p>While Kegley mentions that desires will manifest after 21 days of doing this method, it’s important to note that manifestations are an echo from the universe; there is no deadline. Remember to be patient and understand that these things will take time.</p>
	<p>To meditate, you must strive to clear your mind and meditate to see all perspectives. For manifestation to work via this process, you must be subconsciously aware of your surroundings and trust your intuition; don’t give up hope, as it weakens your intuition!</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Actively work towards your manifestations. An important part of manifestations is your coexistence with the universe. While you call to the universe and expect a call back, you must work towards these manifestations actively. The universe builds upon your efforts to provide you your desires. Based on our previous example, manifesting good grades won’t work unless you actively work towards them. Expecting the universe to provide with no base will cause the manifestation to weaken or fail.</p>
	<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> Vibe check! The strength of your manifestations is solely based on your resonance with the universe; for you to reap the best possible benefits, strive to maintain a positive frequency for the universe to reflect back upon. In other words, try to have good vibes!</p>
	<p>Now that you have a deeper understanding in manifestation, have fun! Call to the universe, and be sure to listen for its response.</p>

      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
	<p>Psychic influence is one of the most interesting topics in the psychic field and one of the easy to develop powers without much experience. Anyone can use this power with little effort once they start practicing it. Every one of us use this power in our daily lives either consciously or unconsciously to influence someone to obey you and do your work or to make someone to act in a particular way. Even others too influence us without our knowledge or intention.</p>
	<p>Most of us influence others by meeting them and communicating with them directly. But, psychic influence is a method of influencing by just using your mind from a distance. The influenced person would never come to know that you have used your psychic power to influence them and act naturally as if he or she doing that work according to their will.</p>
	<p>Psychic influence can be used for either good or bad, but it is strictly recommended to use only for the highest good of all. This power can be used for anything, from negotiating to seduction. If you use this power to influence someone to do something bad or to cause bad, then the bad will come to you in 10 fold. The general occasions where you can use this power are negotiating with the sales person, influencing your boss to approve your proposal, making someone to help you in your matters, approval for your bank loan, and so on.</p>
	<p>Every day, when we think of someone, we actually are projecting our psychic power to them. The person on the other side will also act in some or other way according to our thinking if our thoughts are powerful. The more bonding relationship between two of you, the more he or she will be influenced, no matter how much the distance is. But, once you develop your powers, the person will get influenced even if you both do not have any relationship.</p>
	<p>You must remember that, using your powers only one time is generally not enough to influence anyone. Projecting your thoughts must be done repeatedly and with an intense focus. Also remember that if the person is protected by a psychic shield or have some psychic self defense, then it is almost impossible for you to influence him.</p>
	<p><strong>Principles of Psychic Influence:</strong></p>
	<p>According to a book “Clairvoyance and Occult Powers By Swami Panchadasi”, in order to develop your psychic power to influence others, you must impress the three principles stated below in your mind. The three principles are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Strong Desire:</strong> The first step to success in anything is to cultivate a strong intense desire. When you have a will power and a burning desire in your mind, the thoughts you send will have a power to manifest your wish or intention.</li>
		<li><strong>Clear Visualization:</strong> The next step of course is the most crucial one and may need some practice to achieve this. Visualization is the key step to impress our thoughts and influence the person. Whether it is an idea or a feeling or may be something you want the other person to do, it is important to imagine and picture the person in your mind clearly.</li>
		<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Concentration is another step required for your success in influencing the person. You need focus upon the suggestion or an impression you want to plant on the other persons mind. When you concentrate, your energies will be conserved and used in a proper way. Concentration awakens our mind powers and channels them in a particular direction.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The greater the degree you can learn these three mental conditions, the greater will be your success in performing a psychic influence. A daily meditation will help you to achieve these conditions.</p>
	<p><strong>Psychic Influence Techniques:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Relax:</strong> Get in a comfortable position and relax either by doing meditation or by listening to an audio. You can buy one if you wish from here either a brainwaves or hypnosis audio. This will help you to focus your thoughts and project it.</li>
		<li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Now the next step is to visualize in your mind what you want the other person to do. Picture in your mind, the other person doing or feeling according to your suggestions.</li>
		<li><strong>Project:</strong> While visualizing as in above step, project the energy on to the other person forehead. Imagine energy like a fine thread passing in to their forehead.</li>
		<li><strong>Use Phrase:</strong> Use some phrase which describes your intention and say it in your mind while projecting your energy in to their forehead. Use energy and concentration as much as possible when you send your message. You can say a message something like, “John accepts (your name) proposal”.</li>
		<li><strong>Hold the Thought:</strong> Hold the thought for a while, may be a minute or two and then just relax.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Always remember that you must be in a relaxed state while doing psychic influence and must not force yourself which will make you more stress. The technique must be used repeatedly on consistent basis to have a profound image on the other persons mind.</p>
	<p>Our minds have a massive power and you can learn more secrets of mind power here.</p>
